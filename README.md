# Web-Analytics

You may find some production code which would help you to:

Get the data from MySQL server and display it in a google sheet where you can leverage to see trends and creat KPIs.

* You might need to edit the file to personalize it for yourself so I request you to get:
1) Google sheet tokens : https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html
2) You will aslo need MySQL credentials.
